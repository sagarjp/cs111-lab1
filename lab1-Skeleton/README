Our implementation of Lab 1B, and in particular the file 'execute-command.c', passes
all of the many test cases we tried to execute on the timetrash program.

One limitation however is insufficient documentation and cleaning up of code. Due to
time constraints and long, complicated code, though the code is perfectly functional
and passes all the multiple test cases that we tried, is not very clean or well 
documented. We hope to correct this in Lab 1C.
